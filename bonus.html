    <h1>The Red Lex</h1>
    <p>
        Alexander Joseph Luthor is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.
        The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Lex Luthor originally appeared in Action Comics No.
        23 (cover dated: April 1940). He has since endured as the archenemy of Superman.
        Lex Luthor was originally depicted as a narcissistic and egotistical mad scientist, but since the late 1980s, he
        has more often been portrayed as a power-mad business magnate, the CEO of LexCorp. He wishes to rid the world of
        Superman, ostensibly because he views Superman as a threat to humanity, but in reality envies Superman's
        popularity and influence.
