        The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Lex Luthor originally appeared in Action Comics No.

        Lex Luthor was originally depicted as a narcissistic and egotistical mad scientist, but since the late 1980s, he
        has more often been portrayed as a power-mad business magnate, the CEO of LexCorp. He wishes to rid the world of
        Superman, ostensibly because he views Superman as a threat to humanity, but in reality envies Superman's
        popularity and influence.
